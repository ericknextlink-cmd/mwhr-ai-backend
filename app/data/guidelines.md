# Contractor Certification & Classification Guideline

**Ministry of Works and Housing (Ghana)**  
**Date:** 10.12.2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this guideline is to:

- Provide a clear and transparent framework for the certification and classification of contractors who intend to undertake building, civil, electrical and plumbing works under the oversight of the Ministry of Works and Housing (MWH).
- Ensure that contractors bidding for public-works projects meet the minimum technical, financial and administrative requirements to deliver quality, safe and sustainable infrastructure.
- Promote accountability, efficiency, and value for money in procurement of works by public agencies.
- Facilitate regular renewal and monitoring of contractor status to maintain competence and compliance with standards, including the Ghana Standards Authority building code and other regulatory requirements.
- Provide guidance on grading/classification, application process, renewal, monitoring and sanctions for non-compliance.

## 2. Scope

This guideline applies to:

- All companies, firms or individual contractors (sole proprietors, partnerships, limited liability companies) that wish to be certified by MWH (through its classification unit) to undertake building, civil works, electrical or plumbing contracts financed by the Government of Ghana or its agencies.
- Public agencies, ministries, departments and regional/municipal assemblies that engage contractors for works and require classification as part of their eligibility criteria. (See sample tender notices requiring certificate D1/K1 etc.)
- The classification, renewal and upgrading (or downgrading) of contractor certification.
- The establishment of monitoring, audit and enforcement mechanisms to ensure that certified contractors maintain required standards and ethical behaviour.

## 3. Definitions

For the purposes of this guideline:

- **Certification:** The formal issuance of a "Contractor Classification Certificate" by the MWH, specifying category (building, civil, electrical, plumbing), class/grade (e.g., D1, D2 ... K1, K2 ... E1, E2 ...) and validity period.
- **Classification/Grading:** The assignment of a contractor to a category and class based on their technical capacity, financial strength, track record, equipment, manpower, etc.
- **Category:** Type of contract works the contractor is eligible to undertake (e.g., General Building Works, General Civil Works, General Electrical Works, General Plumbing Works)
- **Class/Grade:** Level of competence/scale of works the contractor may bid for (e.g., D1/K1 highest; D4/K4 lower)
- **Applicant:** A contractor applying for certification, classification, renewal, upgrade or reclassification.
- **Certificate Holder:** A contractor whose classification certificate has been issued and is valid.
- **Renewal:** The process by which a certificate holder applies to extend validity of their certificate beyond the initial period.
- **Upgrade:** The process by which a contractor applies to move to a higher class (e.g., from D3 to D2) based on improved capacity/track record.
- **Downgrade/Revocation:** The process by which the MWH reduces the class or revokes the certificate because of non-compliance, poor performance or misconduct.

## 4. Classification Categories and Classes

### 4.1 Categories

- General Building Works (Category D)
- General Civil Works (Category K)
- General Electrical Works (Category E)
- General Plumbing Works (Category G)

### 4.2 Classes / Grades

Typical grading structure:

- D1 / K1 (highest)
- D2 / K2
- D3 / K3

And for electrical: E1, E2, E3. Plumbing: G1, G2.

### 4.3 Scope of Work by Class

- Contractors classified as D1/K1 may bid for large scale government contracts, major infrastructure, multi-million cedi projects.
- Contractors at D4/K4 are restricted to smaller works, limited financial exposure, simpler technical requirements.
- Certification must clearly indicate the maximum contract value or class of works permissible for the contractor, based on vetted capacity.

## 5. Application Process (New Certification or Upgrade)

### 5.1 Pre-application steps

- The applicant should review the minimum requirements for their desired class (D1, D2 etc) to confirm they meet standards.

### 5.2 Submission of Application

- Application form to be obtained from the MWH Classification Unit (Room 39, 1st Floor, MWH Block, PO Box M43, Ministries, Accra) or via official website.

- Letters of award for contracts executed in the past 5 years (or appropriate period), final payment certificates or latest interim certificates.
- Company profile describing organisation, staffing, previous projects, and technical capacity.
- Any additional documentation as required by the specific class (for example, higher class may require larger contract history, more equipment, more staff).

### 5.4 Evaluation and Committee Vetting

- A Contractors Classification Committee evaluates the application, verifies documents, may follow up with site visits or references checks.

### 5.5 Decision and Payment

- The applicant is informed of committee decision: approved, conditionally approved (pending further verification), or rejected.
- If approved, contractor is informed of certificate fee and payment amount (as per prevailing rates).

### 5.6 Issuance of Certificate

- On payment, the Classification Unit issues the Contractor Classification Certificate indicating category, class/grade, validity period, unique certificate number, scope of works allowed.
- Certificate should also indicate obligations of the contractor (e.g., renewal conditions, compliance, reporting of changes).

### 5.7 Turnaround Time

- The Ministry aims to process new/upgrading certification within 21 working days from complete submission of required documents.

## 6. Renewal and Upgrading

## 14. Implementation Tips for MWH

- Publish this guideline on your website and publicise it widely (contractors' associations, engineering/architectural societies, MMDA procurement units).
- Develop an electronic system (or upgrade existing system) to manage contractor data: application tracking, certificate issuance, renewal alerts, register of certified contractors, performance database.
- Integrate classification-certificate verification with procurement portals so contracting agencies automatically verify eligibility (category/class/expiry) when evaluating bids.
- Provide training sessions for smaller contractors to understand the classification system, how to meet requirements and build capacity for upgrading.
- Maintain a feedback mechanism: contractors may raise concerns or propose improvements. Regular stakeholder consultation is beneficial.
- Consider periodic evaluation of contractor performance and publishing a "black‐list" or "non-performer list" (with caution for reputational and legal implications) to deter poor performance.
- Ensure that the classification criteria are reviewed and updated to suit evolving construction industry norms, inflation, technological advances and safety standards.

## 15. Conclusion

A robust certification and classification regime under the MWH helps ensure that only suitably qualified and resourced contractors engage in public works, which promotes transparency, quality, safety and value for money. By following the procedures and criteria set out in this guideline, the Ministry—and its contracting agencies—can strengthen procurement outcomes and contractor performance. Moreover, by publishing and enforcing these guidelines, the Ministry sends a strong signal to the industry about standards and expectations.
